# JENKINS CI/CD PIPELINE
The primary objective of this project is to gain practical experience by developing a comprehensive and automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment/Delivery pipeline utilizing Jenkins.

## What I did in this project:
- [x] Created a demo Springboot application.
- [x] Defined a Jenkins Pipeline by including a text file - named `Jenkinsfile` - containing the pipeline script, at the root of my application.
- [x] Defined the Scripted Pipeline using [Groovy-related syntax](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/).
- [x] Set up code coverage analysis using [Jacoco](https://www.baeldung.com/jacoco).
- [x] Set up the automated generation of a Docker container image
- [ ] Deployment of the Docker container image to a Docker hub repository with jib gradle plugin.
