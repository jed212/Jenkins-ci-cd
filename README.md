# JENKINS CI/CD PIPELINE
What I did in this project:
* Created a demo Springboot application.
* Defined a Jenkins Pipeline by including a text file - named `Jenkinsfile` - containing the pipeline script, at the root of my application.
* Defined the Scripted Pipeline using [Groovy-related syntax](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/syntax/).
* Set up code coverage analysis using [Jacoco](https://www.baeldung.com/jacoco).
* Set up the automated generation and deployment of a Docker container image to a docker hub repository with jib gradle plugin.
